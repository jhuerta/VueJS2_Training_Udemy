- Lesson 1: https://codepen.io/jhbrogeras/pen/QOZVdY

- A Vue instance (new Vue) defines the application, and it selcts a bit of the HTML
- Access methods and properties (data) through this
- v-on:EVENT_NAME='DO_THIS' : Listen on event and do something
- v-on:input : Event triggered on input


* Section 2
- Directives:
	v-once
	v-html
	v-bind:'attribute'='method' === :attribute="method"
	v-on:event='method' === @event='method'
	v-on: Listen on events (v-on:event='action_to_execute')
	v-on: Listen on events (v-on:event='action_to_execute(arg_1, $event)')
		$event is a reserve keyword to pass the event object (which is passed by default if only one argument)
	v-model: 2 ways binding
- Computed property will only be executed if any of the variables inside the method changes. However, if using a method as a varible, that method used in a variable will be executed EVERYTIME A data property changes values (everytime the DOM changes), regardless whether it is used or no in the method. It runs synchronously!!
- watch: Watches variables and acts if there is a change
- computed, watched, data
	watched is on variables that are defined in data or computed. So, when the data variable changes, the watched method is execute
	computed is a variable that depends on the DOM. Everytime the DOM changes, the computed will be executed, regardless the computed depends on the property that has changed or not
- :class="{'class_name_1': boolean_property,class_name_2': boolean_property}"
- :class="computed_property"
	computed_property: function(){
		return 
			{
				'class_name_1': boolean_property,
				class_name_2': boolean_property
			}
	}
- Multiple ways to attach dynamically a class:
	- Using a variable to modify the inline style
	- Using a computed property to retun an object with class: boolean
	- Assigning an array wih classes. This array can contain a mix of classes and boolean classes
- v-if will remove the element from the DOM (not hide, but rather completely remove)
-v-show : To hide, rather than removing from the dom
- make sure to add a :key directive when using for loop, to avoid unexepcted behavior
- data (or any other object passed to the Vue instance constructor), can be created outside the Vue constructor itself, as any regular javascript object.
- If the vue instance is stored into a variable, its data and methods can be accessed from any other Javascript object, inclusing any other Vue object
- It is possible to tag an element in the dom with ref='ANY_NAME'. Then, inside the vue instance or outside, this DOM element is accessible throuh vue_instance.$refs.ANY_NAME (or this.$refs....). Notice that modifying the DOM directly may not have the desired effect, as Vue will refresh it automatically based on its own copy of the DOM. However, thi is handy to retrieve values from the DOM (or playing with the DOM other than to modify it).
- It is possible to pass the template as the object selector to a Vue instance:
	vm.mount('#id_app');
- Using development workflow with Vue CLI:
	* npm install -g vue-cli
	* Choose Template:
		Simple
		WebPack Simple <=== Preferred
		Webpack
		Browserify/Browserify Serify (instead of webpack)
	* npm install -g vue-cli
	* vue cli proxy: 
		set HTTP_PROXY=http://193.247.49.64:3128
		set HTTPS_PROXY=http://193.247.49.64:3128
	* npm proxy:
		npm config set proxy http://193.247.49.64:3128
		npm config set https-proxy http://193.247.49.64:3128
- Components can be registered locally or globally
- Components can be named as camel case, and use with hyphen. Altough is preferible to name it the same as it is used
- Remember the style in a component can be scoped per component (instead of globally by default). Use <style scoped>
- Communication between components:
	- Parent to child: pass a prop
	- Child to parent: 
		1) modify the prop (not a good idea, tons of issues)
		2) Custom event from child to parent
		3) The parent pass a method as a prop that the child use - Preferred
	- Child to child (siblings): Communicate to parent and the parent will communicate to the other siblings
	- Universal way: Create a global bus event. Emit events through the global bus, and add listeners in the created method to the global bus (attention to accessing this inside a ON!! Use ES6 nomenclature or assign self = this);
